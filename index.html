		I saw you in a dream
		You had stayed the same
		You were beckoning me
		Said that I had changed
		Tried to keep my eyes closed
		I want you so bad
		Then I awoke and it was so sad
		Haven't talked to you in months
		And I thought that I might cry
		But I'm not that kind of guy
		I saw you in a dream
		You came to me
		You were the sweetest apparition, such a pretty vision
		There was no reason, no explanation
		The perfect hallucination
		All good things come to an end
		But I thought that this might last
		But you came alive so fast
		And when I'm awake I can't switch off
		It isn't the same but it is enough
		I saw you in a dream
		Then it came tonight
		I wonder if you'll come and visit me again
		You take your time to reappear
		I'm starting to believe that when I call your name
		You just don't hear me anymore
		And I know that I shouldn't even try
		It's a waste of time
		And when I'm awake I can't switch off
		It isn't the same but it is enough
		And when I'm awake I can't switch off
		It isn't the same but it is enough
		It isn't the same but it is enough
