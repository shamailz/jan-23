		I saw you in a dream
		You had stayed the same
		You were beckoning me
		Said that I had changed
		Tried to keep my eyes closed
		I want you so bad
		Then I awoke and it was so sad<br>
		Haven't talked to you in months<br>
		And I thought that I might cry<br>
		But I'm not that kind of guy<br>
		I saw you in a dream<br>
		You came to me<br>
		You were the sweetest apparition, <br>
		such a pretty vision<br>
		There was no reason, no explanation<br>
		The perfect hallucination<br>
		All good things come to an end<br>
		But I thought that this might last<br>
		But you came alive so fast<br>
		And when I'm awake I can't switch off<br>
		It isn't the same but it is enough<br>
		I saw you in a dream<br>
		Then it came tonight<br>
		I wonder if you'll come and visit me again<br>
		You take your time to reappear<br>
		I'm starting to believe that when I call your name<br>
		You just don't hear me anymore<br>
		And I know that I shouldn't even try<br>
		It's a waste of time<br>
		And when I'm awake I can't switch off<br>
		It isn't the same but it is enough<br>
		And when I'm awake I can't switch off<br>
		It isn't the same but it is enough<br>
		It isn't the same but it is enough<br>
